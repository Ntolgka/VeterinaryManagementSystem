This is my first Java project I have done **3 years ago** working with database and java swing UI. I plan to organize and update this project in the future with my current information.

## How to setup:

- Start your IDE

- Import mysql connector for java library

  - > (Next 6 stages are for intelliJ Idea)

  - Select Veterinary Management project

  - From the main menu, select File | Project Structure Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S.

  - Under Project Settings, select Libraries.

  - Click the Add button(+) and select one of the following:

  - Select Java to add a library from the files located on your computer.

  - Select the directory where your mysql-connector-java-8.0.24.jar file is located

- Open your MainPage class and run it.

## Make sure your port id, database name, username, password and host information mach with your information.

Finally, you can use our veterinary management system program.
